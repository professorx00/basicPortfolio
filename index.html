                        </p>I am currently a SQL Query Report and Python Developer who works with CTR Maine to create Desktop and Web Service interfaces
                             for a hosted Time and Attendance Software using SOAP API and Direct File Manipulation. I know how to create python scripts
                              to create interface structures to convert files into importable data formats including date/time stamp management, data
                               processing, and graphing data.
                        </p><br>
                        </p>I have developed crucial relationships with clients which has gained increase revenue for the CTR Maine. I even stepped into
                             the secondary side of the business of security by taking incoming SQL Reports and creating a time sheet for employees based on
                              their actual entrance and exit of the building. 
                        </p><br>
                        </p>I am currently attending University of New Hampshire bootcamp for Full Stack Developer. I have also producing 3D assets for Maya,
                             Blender and 3D Max. I have an associate degree in Character Animation from Brooks College. I have taken courses from Animation Mentor
                              where I was taught Python to enhance his ability with animation by using scripting.
                        </p><br>
                        </p>Outside of work, I have many interests. I am involved in Hack Portland and I join their game dev, python, and robotics monthly meetings.
                             I organize a weekly role-playing session which has helped me develop a strong problem solving, social interactions, and creative thinking.
                              I am an avid video game player who not only plays but works on building them.
